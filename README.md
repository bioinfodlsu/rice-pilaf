# RicePilaf
Welcome to RicePilaf, a post-GWAS/QTL analysis dashboard for rice genomes.

RicePilaf takes as input a set of genomic intervals obtained from QTL analysis or from LD-based clumping of significant GWAS SNPs.

It infers possible biological mechanisms by evaluating the enrichment of the loci in co-expression modules and in transcription factors.

To do this, it collates (1) pan-genomic, (2) co-expression, (3) epigenomic, and (4) regulatory information from various sources.

## Demo
A demo version can be seen [here](http://165.22.55.49/).

## Installation and usage
Please visit the RicePilaf [wiki](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/rice-pilaf/wiki).
