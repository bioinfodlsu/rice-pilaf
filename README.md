# Rice Pilaf
Welcome to Rice Pilaf, a post-GWAS analysis dashboard for rice genomes.

Rice-pilaf takes as input GWAS loci, defined here as genomic intervals obtained from LD-based clumping e.g. using [PLINK](https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/clump.shtml).

It produces a ranked list of genes implicated by the GWAS. 

The ranking is produced by collating (1) pan-genomic, (2) co-expression, (3) epigenomic, and (4) regulatory information from various sources.
