Welcome! RicePilaf is short for Rice Post-GWAS/QTL Analysis dashboard. 
Ok, so we are not great at acronyms; but like a flavorful rice pilaf that combines many ingredients,
this RicePilaf combines information from multiple rice databases to provide insights into your QTL/GWAS loci. 

## Installation and usage
Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/rice-pilaf/wiki).

## Demo
A demo version can be seen [here](http://ricepilaf.bioinfodlsu.com/).
It runs on limited computational resources, so installing locally is the way to go.
